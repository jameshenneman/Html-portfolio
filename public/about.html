<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Recently, I decided to change things up a bit and pursue a new career. I am currently working on getting certified
   by Google and Meta in the fields of web development, information technology and cyber security with the hope of 
   leaving the healthcare field to join the tech industry. 
</p>

<p>I have also been putting time into a side hustle. I have been learning how to become an internet retailer to sell things 
  on Amazon via their FBA. Although it will take some time, I wanted to have a passive source of income that takes little 
  energy to maintain.
</p>

<p>In my free time I have also been taking courses on how to learn Python programming so that I could be more comfortable 
  working with ChatGPT. And I've been taking this web development boot camp through Udemy which has been great! I feel 
  like I am learning so much!  
</p>

<p>When I am not doing all those things I am trying to get as much running, weight lifting and reading in as I can. 
  I have been staying busy to say the least!. My future self will thank me for all of it!
